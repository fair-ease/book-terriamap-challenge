## Cloud Optimised Geotiffs (COG)

Cloud Optimised Geotiffs(COG) are an enhancement to the Geotiff data
format that allows for efficient partial downloading and streaming of
georeferenced image or grid data to a client that supports the format.
Typically Cloud Optimised Geotiffs are used to display satellite
imagery.

An example Sentinel 2 true colour (TCI) Satellite imagery from the Hunga
Tonga area was downloaded (see
[S2B_60KYF_20220113_0_L2A](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1/collections/sentinel-2-l2a/items/S2B_60KYF_20220113_0_L2A?.language=en&.asset=asset-visual))
and added to TerriaMap configuration, the map projection format of the
data necessitated the use of the “3D” Map view in Terriamap to visualise
the imagery (The TerriaMap 3D view, better supported the geotiff’s map
projection)

### COG Digital Elevation Model (DEM) snippet

Digital Elevation Model data may also be available in cloud optimised
geotiff format. Some example DEM data from Mt. Etna was configured in
Terriamap.
