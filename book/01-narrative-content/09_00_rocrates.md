## Location-tagged RO-Crates

During the Hackathon a brief investigation was conducted into how
RO-Crate geospatial metadata could be imported into TerriaMap. Some of
the web sources of RO-Crates were investigated. It was found that there
is some divergence as to how geospatial metadata is implemented in
RO-Crates. Further investigation would be required, possibly looking at approaches to extracting and indexing geospatial data in RO-Crate archives and generating a csv or geojson file to visualise points or areas relevant to specific RO-Crates in TerriaMap. 

### RO-Crate geospatial metadata Specification

This is the guidance on how to represent geospatial metadata in an
RO-Crate
[<u>https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-DRAFT/contextual-entities.html#places</u>](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2-DRAFT/contextual-entities.html#places)


Not every implementation follows this guidance as it is not mandatory,
it is a recommendation.

filter by tags \> location, there are just a few location-tagged
datasets there. They can be downloaded as RO-Crates from the individual
dataset page. They use location to link to the geospatial metadata

(the full dataset is >1GB but the metadata can be downloaded
separately)

Itâ€™s a single RO-Crate containing a collection of many interviews, each
interview has location data linked through contentLocation - the
metadata follows this guidance in the RO-Crate specification:

filtered for Earth and Environmental Sciences - a number of datasets
have location data.

They use geographicalCoverage to link it (a term from the Dataverse
schema)
