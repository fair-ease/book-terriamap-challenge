### WPS

There were mixed results using the TerriaMaps WPS support

For the Examind WPS service:
[<u>https://examind.eoscfe.mesocentre.uca.fr/examind/WS/wps/WPS</u>](https://examind.eoscfe.mesocentre.uca.fr/examind/WS/wps/WPS)

On some processes, the TerraiMap client crashes when using WPS services,
Examind automatically exposes processes containing complex objects, but
these are not supported by Terriamap, which seems to make it crash when
you try to access the process.

To fix this issue would involve either modifying the way Examind works,
or modifying the Terriamap code to avoid crashing in the case of unknown
objects (which was not possible to do in the time allotted for the
hackathon)

Another Issue encountered, was that when you try to export the result of
a WPS request into a WMS (WPS works, WMS works, but the bridge between
them is broken) TerriaMap seems to wait for a WMS “response” after this
WPS process.
```json
{
"name": "Examind WPS",
"id": "wpsexamind",
"url": "https://examind.eoscfe.mesocentre.uca.fr/examind/WS/wps/WPS",
"isOpen": false,
"type": "wps-getCapabilities"
}
```
Further investigation of the usage and support of WPS in Terriamap is
needed, this may also require code contributions for improvements to
TerriaMap WPS support.
