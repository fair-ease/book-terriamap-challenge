## FAIR-EASE Data services and Data Sources used in the Hackathon

The FAIR-EASE Hackathon was themed around the Hunga Tonga Volcanic
eruption. As part of the TerriaMap Challenge the various datasets
selected for the challenge were mainly chosen out of relevance to the
Hunga Tonga study area and the various use case themes to provide a
focused cross disciplinary example TerriaMap configuration.

A number of useful open source environmental data serving technologies
are of interest to many of the FAIR-EASE Use Cases, technologies such as
Examind (Geomatys), Thredds (Unidata [Thredds
Server](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/)),
[ERDDAP](https://github.com/ERDDAP/erddap)(NOAA), Beacon (Maris),
Geodab, IDDAS as well as new cloud optimised data storage formats and
approaches for working with Large archives of data stored in cloud S3
compatible Object stores such as with STAC Catalogs.

The following sections describe how different data sources were
investigated during the hackathon and the configurations that were used
to add these datasets and data sources to TerriaMap.
