# OGC CSW Catalogue support

TerriaMap Supports various data catalogue services like CKAN, ArcGIS
portal etc as described in their “[Catalog
Group](https://docs.terria.io/guide/connecting-to-data/catalog-groups/)”
documentation. OGC CSW Metadata catalogues are supported via the
“[csw-group](https://docs.terria.io/guide/connecting-to-data/catalog-type-details/csw-group/)”
“catalog group”. The TerriaMap “Catalog Groups” allow various services
e.g. WMS layers to be dynamically discovered from metadata references
and made available in the TerriaMap. The hackathon did not have enough
time to investigate this functionality, but this functionality would
obviously allow an organisation to leverage published metadata services
to drive discovery and visualisation of available geospatial data. The
TerriaMap Documentation provides an example of a csw-group configuration
