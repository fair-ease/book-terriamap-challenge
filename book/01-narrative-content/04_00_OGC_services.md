# OGC Services

TerriaMap has quite robust support for the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) Web Service and geospatial data standards and the various widely
used web server technologies like Geoserver, ArcGIS Server that publish
OGC compliant web services. In the following section we provide some of
the example configurations we used to bring example services into
TerriaMap. Examind and iFremerâ€™s Sextant server (which uses
[Geonetwork](https://www.geonetwork-opensource.org/) and
[Geoserver](https://geoserver.org/)) support a wider set of OGC Service
Standards than Thredds (OGC WMS and OCG WCS) and ERDDAP (OGC WMS).
